-- steps to make our data warehouse

-- 1. Define Our business problem .what is the most used frequency of purchase per each season
-- 2. Identify grain. Our grain will be frequency of Purchase and season
-- 3. Identify dimension. Our dimesion will be frequency of purchase and season
-- 4. Identify fact. Fact in this case will be count of frequency of purchase

 --  creating our dimension TABLE

 create table dim_frequency(
    id int,
    frequency_of_purchase varchar(50)
 );

 insert into dim_frequency(id, frequency_of_purchase)
 select customer_id, frequency_of_purchases from shopping_data;

 -- creating our season dimension table
 create table dim_season(
    id int,
    season varchar(50)
 );

 insert into dim_season(id, season)
 select customer_id, season from shopping_data;

 -- solving our business problem
 -- creating a central table to help query data for us to analyse
 create temp table analysis as 
 select ds.id, ds.season, df.frequency_of_purchase
 from dim_season ds
 left join dim_frequency df on df.id = ds.id;

select * from analysis;

with analysis_cte as (
SELECT season, frequency_of_purchase, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
FROM analysis
GROUP BY season, frequency_of_purchase)

SELECT season, frequency_of_purchase 
FROM analysis_cte
WHERE rnk = 1;

--  products with high review rating

-- 1. Define Our business problem .what are the products with high review rating
-- 2. Identify grain. Our grain will be category
-- 3. Identify dimension. Our dimesion will be category
-- 4. Identify fact. Fact in this case will be review rating

select * from shopping_data;

-- creating a table to help with our analysis
create table high_review_rating(
   id int,
   category varchar(50),
   review_rating REAl
);

insert into high_review_rating(id, category, review_rating)
select customer_id, category, review_rating from shopping_data;


-- creating our dimension TABLE

create table dim_category(
   id int,
   category VARCHAR(50)

);

insert into dim_category(id, category)
select id, category from high_review_rating;

-- solving our business problem

select category, round(avg(review_rating),1) as average_rating
from high_review_rating
group by category
order by average_rating desc;
